# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is an **analytical** approach aimed at uncovering the inherent characteristics of datasets, utilizing **statistical** (non-graphical) and **visualization** (graphical) techniques.

## Agenda

- to gain insights into the data by summarizing its main characteristics:

  - **Find patterns**,
  - **Identify outliers**,
  - **Explore the relationship between variables**,
  - **Helps to indentify features** (aka feature selection)

## EDA techniques:

  - Basic Statistical Summary
  - Histogram and Density Plot
  - Box Plots
  - Violin Plot
  - Time Series Plot and Bar Chart
  - Correlation Analysis
  - Bivariate Relationships (Bivariate Scatter and Pair Plot )
  - Automatic EDA Tools
