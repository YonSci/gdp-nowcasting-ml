# Machine Learning for Economic Nowcasting: Real-Time GDP Estimation with Google Trends


**Why GDP nowcasting matters**:

- Calculating quarterly Gross Domestic Product (GDP) requires data from various sources, including government records and surveys. This data often takes 2-3 weeks to become available after the end of each quarter, making it difficult to have a real-time understanding of the economy.

- **Improve timeliness**: Traditional GDP estimates rely on surveys and administrative data, which have reporting lags. ML models can provide real-time estimates before official data is available.

- **Enhance accuracy**: Machine learning can integrate high-frequency data (Google Trends, financial transactions, satellite data) to improve estimates.

- **Optimize resource use**: Reduces dependency on costly and time-consuming traditional surveys by using alternative data sources.

- **Supporting economic policy**: Governments and policymakers need early economic insights (early warning signals) to make informed decisions and get early signals of economic changes for timely interventions. E.g: Governments can respond faster to economic slowdowns or booms.

- **Tracking economic shocks**: Detects economic downturns (e.g., COVID-19 impact, financial crises) before official statistics confirm them.
  
- **Improving investor confidence**: Real-time GDP estimates allow investors to make better decisions about trade, foreign direct investment (FDI), and market stability.
