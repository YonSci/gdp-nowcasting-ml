# Setting up the Python Development Environment

## Objective:
- To help participants set up a Python development environment on their machines and familiarize themselves with the tools required for the workshop.

## Key Topics:

1) Installing Python via Anaconda Distribution
2) Using conda and pip package managers
3) Creating a Virtual Environment
4) Setting Up Integrated Development Environment (IDE)  such as Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code
5) Using Google Colab

## Activities:
- Hands-on installation of Python/Anaconda.
